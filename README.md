<h1 align="center">Welcome to Rachel's Github ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Hi this is Rachel. 

I'm a PhD student at NYU and I'm passionate about vision science. 

My interests lie in:
1. leveraging computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques to unravel the complexities of human visual encoding process;
2. understanding the differences between human vision and computer vision.

By studying the unique properties of human visual perception, I'm interested in developing computer vision systems that can more accurately mimic human visual capabilities, as well as advancing VR/AR techniques. 

Let's get connected if you are also enthusiastic about vision science and AI!
